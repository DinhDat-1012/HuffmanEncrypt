"Humans weren't born to compress themselves too much," he said. "Even data, if compressed too hard, 
becomes corrupted. How much more so for humans."

That statement followed him throughout the rest of the day.

In the afternoon, he reached a small rest stop – just an old wooden shack, but enough to provide shade 
and had a long bench. On the bench was an abandoned book. He opened it to look. It was an old philosophy 
book, the pages had turned yellow and a few pages had torn corners.

Reading a few passages, he again associated it with data compression. The book said that all human 
knowledge was "dimensionally reduced," compressed across generations. What humans remember is only 
a small part of what they have experienced. Like a lossless compression algorithm, but also unable to 
preserve the complete experience.

He sat there until the sun gradually set behind his back. Though only for a few short hours, he felt 
the vastness of space as if uncompressing a multi-gigabyte compressed file – making his soul feel 
expanded, comfortable, and relaxed.

"When I return," he thought, "the city will compress me again."
But this time, perhaps he would know how to keep space for himself.

Night fell once more. But this time, he didn't camp. He walked along the lake shore, looking at the 
flat water surface reflecting the faint moonlight. It was a moment when everything became silent – no 
more multithreading, no more resource competition, no more tangled code fragments in his head.

There was only one single thread running: peace.

He took out his notebook and wrote more:

"Tomorrow will continue again. And even though I don't know what lies ahead, I will still go. Because 
this path – like my life – needs to be decompressed step by step.""Humans weren't born to compress themselves too much," he said. "Even data, if compressed too hard, 
becomes corrupted. How much more so for humans."
